ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Deudon â€” an embedded systems engineer and data scientist with expertise in machine learning, signal processing, and full-stack development.

Iâ€™ve worked on intelligent sensor systems for healthcare, developing fall detection algorithms, optimizing AI models for embedded hardware, and building web/mobile applications for real-time monitoring. My research background at CNRS focused on EEG signal analysis, machine learning for epilepsy detection, and spiking neural network modeling. I also have experience as a freelance developer implementing computer vision algorithms and interactive applications.

My toolbox includes Python, PyTorch, web technologies (React Native, JavaScript), Docker, SQL, Git, and more. I enjoy designing efficient algorithms, turning raw data into insights, and building reliable systems from hardware to cloud.
